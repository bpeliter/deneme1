1) We designed a simple note taking web app. We believe that people need a ligthweighted program that they can take notes, they can keep the record of movies they intend to watch or songs which they want to remember. It will have a minimalist and easy to read interface, allowing users to enter input easily.
2) Opening the website -> (there are 3 options) Select Notes or Songlist or Watchlist from sidebar and move to that page. 
-> Enter the required information in inputs in order to save your notes, songs or movies .
-> After clicking add buttons your submission will be stored in the local storage and will be shown in the bottom.
-> Apply a checked situation on your submission by clicking on it(only in Songlist and Watchlist) .
-> Delete your submission by clicking x on right top corner of it. It will delete the information from the local storage.
3) Members are: Berkin Peliter, Omer Dalgin, Irem Kalsin, Zeynep Ertav(We did everything together)

5) You can download our open source project from https://github.com/iremkalsin/cs-391. After that, you should open index.html and run via any web browser you like(preferably on chrome). After entering the index.html page, you have 3 options: Select Notes or Songlist or Watchlist. After entering the page you want, you will get empty input sections that requires filling. After filling all the sections correctly, you can save your inputs. If you are done with your submission you can either click on it to apply a checked or you can simply delete it by clicking the x button on top right corner of the submission.\
